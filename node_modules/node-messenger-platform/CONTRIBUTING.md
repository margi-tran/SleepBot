# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in node-messenger-platform. All forms of contribution are
welcome, from issue reports to PRs and documentation / write-ups.

Please read [this doc](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) before contributing.

Before you open a PR:

* If you're planning to add or change a major feature in a PR, please ensure
the change is aligned with the project roadmap by opening an issue first,
especially if you're going to spend a lot of time on it.
* After development, run `npm test` to check if all tests pass.
* Be careful to follow the code style of the project. Run `npm run lint` after
your changes and ensure you do not introduce any new errors or warnings.
* All new features and changes need documentation.
